# Sales Comparison Report (Frontend Assignment)

## Project Overview
This project is a single-page React application developed as part of a frontend hiring evaluation. 
It consumes a live backend API and presents sales comparison data in a structured, analytical report format.

## Tech Stack & Libraries Used
- React.js – Frontend framework
- Material UI (MUI) – UI components and layout
- Axios – API integration
- Recharts – Data visualization (charts)

## Application Features
- Single-page analytical report (no routing)
- Live backend API integration
- Loading and error handling
- Tabular data representation using MUI Table
- Graphical analysis using Line and Bar charts
- Clean, professional report layout

## Backend API
Endpoint:
http://74.225.26.105:8000/salecomparison/lmtd/gsm

Note:
The backend API currently returns an internal server error due to a database connectivity issue.
Backend modifications were strictly prohibited, so the frontend handles this gracefully by displaying a clear error message.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Hosted Application URL
(To be updated after deployment)

## Report Output
The report is presented as a single-page layout and can be exported as a PDF using the browser print functionality.
